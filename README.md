# WeatherForecastWebsite


It's my examination project for the JS course. It's developed using Bootstrap, Vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. I'm using two APIs : openweathermap.org and bigdatacloud.net. The aim of the website is to show the current weather forecast as well as for the next 5 days hourly and by day.
